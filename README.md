CREDITS
This project owes a lot to the WAC project, ref [3]. It's a lot easier
to have a working code example to look at than to only have the
specifications. You may do any changes to this code but must make sure
to mention that in history. You must also to keep a reference to the
originals, not just this project but also to the WAC project.
Thanks also to W3C [1] and Mozilla [2] for their online documentation.

To compile the test scripts some tools may be needed.
sudo apt-get install binaryen emscripten gcc-multilib g++-multilib libedit-dev:i386
